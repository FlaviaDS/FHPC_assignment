This folder contains files related to the MPI Weak scalability study on nodes of the THIN partition on the ORFEO cluster (https://orfeo-doc.areasciencepark.it/HPC/computational-resources/), for 1 and 12 threads both. The naming of files follows the following rule: mpi_weak_scalability_t_#threads.txt. The other two files are the Python script used to plot data (\texttt{.ipynb]) and the graph produced (.png).
