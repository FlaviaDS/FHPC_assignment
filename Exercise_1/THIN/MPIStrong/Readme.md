This folder contains files related to the MPI Strong scalability study on nodes of the THIN partition on the ORFEO cluster (https://orfeo-doc.areasciencepark.it/HPC/computational-resources/). The strong scalability study was carried out for different grid sizes, for 1 and 12 threads both. The naming of files follows the following rule: mpi_strong_scalability_t_#threads_s_#size.txt. The other two files are the Python script used to plot data (.ipynb) and the graph produced (.png).
