This folder contains files related to the MPI Weak scalability study on nodes of the EPYC partition on the ORFEO cluster (https://orfeo-doc.areasciencepark.it/HPC/computational-resources/). The naming of files follows the following rule: mpi_weak_scalability_e_#threads.txt.
The other two files are the Python script used to plot data (.ipynb) and the graph produced (.png).
