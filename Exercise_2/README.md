# Exercise 2
This directory contains the results of the scalability analyses of the **BLIS**, **OBLAS** and **MKL** libraries for the gemm matrix-matrix multiplication function. The analysis was conducted on both EPYC and THIN nodes of the Orfeo cluster at AREASciencePark.

## Folder Structure

- The **Core Scaling** and **Size Scaling** folders each contain two subfolders (**EPYC_*** and **THIN_***) and each of the subfolder contains two other folders (**close** and **spread**) that store data coming from to single and double-precision operations.

## Graphs

Graphs were generated by plotting the mean values from five iterations.

More details are given in the `Report_FHPC.pdf`file.
